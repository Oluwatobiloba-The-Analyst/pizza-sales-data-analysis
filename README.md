## üîç Key Insights

### 1. Sales Volume & Revenue  
- Over **21,000 orders** placed, generating **$817,860** in total revenue.  
- A total of **49,570 pizzas** sold, averaging **2.32 pizzas per order**.  
- **Average order value:** $38.31 ‚Äî indicating moderate upsell behavior.  

### 2. Size Preference  
- Large (L) pizzas generated the highest sales revenue ($375.32K) and demand (18,956 units). This may be due to customers' preference for the large size.  
- XXL and XL sizes underperformed, likely due to pricing or portion mismatch with customer preferences.  

### 3. Category Performance  
- **Classic pizzas** led in both revenue ($220.05K) and quantity sold (14,888 units). This could be because customers lean towards the familiar or because it taste better.
 
- Supreme, Chicken, and Veggie also performed well with evenly distributed sales.  

### 4. Product Performance

- **Fridays (8,242 units)** and **Saturdays (7,493 units)** recorded the highest sales, this could be due to weekend parties and people's free time to relax and enjoy themselves. This also suggests ideal days for targeted promos and marketing.

- **Revenue spikes** observed in **March, May, July, and November**, (each exceeding $70K), indicating potential seasonality, promotion-driven spikes, or campaign effect.
